\begin{abstract}
Industry 4.0 has made huge progress by providing exciting new applications facilitating, for example, factory management and configuration. However, less attention has been given on the security concerns introduced by the greater device connectivity. This is particularly bothersome with the use of technologies, such as, Internet of Things (IoT) which increases the attack surface of the system. This has been witnessed by recent attacks involving IoT devices. The goal of this project is to study the use of Model Based Security Engineering techniques in building (more) secure Industry 4.0 systems. We will use the pick-and-place system already available at fortiss as main use-case modeling and analyzing its security concerns in an extension of \autofocus\ with security concerns. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The new generation of manufacturing, the so-called Industry 4.0, is providing new and exciting features. Managers can easily configure an industry plant to the customer's needs, as well as help engineers to manage the factory by using, for example, plug-and-produce equipment. With the introduction of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices will provide even more features, such as accessing the factory remotely as well as allow the factory to use services on the cloud, such as IoT Watson. 

While providing such features is desirable, such connectivity increases the attack surface of factories. For example, if a compromised equipment is plugged in a factory, it may gain access to secret resources or cause the factory to behave abnormally affecting the factory's productivity or even cause some serious damage to the factory placing in danger the company's employees. In order to avoid such events, it is important to place security counter measures, such as the use of encryption keys, security protocols, and even physical barriers, reducing thus vulnerabilities and security risk. 

Model Based Security Engineering (MBSE)~\cite{umlsec,casesec} is a methodology which brings together requirement and design engineers to analyze more carefully both safety and security concerns and their inter-dependencies. By specifying requirements and verifying whether a design complies with the requirements, engineers can avoid attacks reducing security risks to the factory. MBSE helps, for example, determine which counter-measures and where in a system should be placed. For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If a security requirement specifies the integrity of the data transmitted through a signal, then  access control and signature mechanisms should be placed to enforce this requirement;

  \item In the same way, security requirements can specify whether some information flow from some (untrusted) signal shall not be used by some critical device. This requirement shall trigger counter measures that avoid such information flows to occur.
\end{itemize}
 MBSE also guides the types of verification that can be deployed, for example, formal verification or security testing.
